This is the capstone project of the neue fische Data Science Bootcamp. It was a collaborative effort between [Christina Rudolf](https://github.com/christinarudolf), [Raymond Boateng](https://github.com/RayKwame) and [Juliane Berek](https://github.com/julianeberek).


## Introduction

The H1N1 influenza pandemic (also known as swine influenza) was caused by H1N1 influenza virus and affected the world between June 2009 to August 2010 (according to WHO declaration). It was the most recent pandemic prior to COVID19. An estimated 11 - 21% of the global population was affected, with deaths in the U.S. totalling 12,469.

This project aimed to:
- Help to increase vaccination rates for seasonal and pandemic flu in the overall population (this reducing the burden of influenza by decreasing hospitalisations/ deaths)
- Identify factors that determine the chance of getting vaccinated
- Identify groups with lower likelihood for getting vaccinated, in order to target them with promotions
- Determine differences of seasonal vs. H1N1 (pandemic) vaccinations


## Description of dataset

The original data was collected through the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey in the U.S. between 2009 - 2010. The current dataset formed part of the DrivenData Challenge ["Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines"](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/)
